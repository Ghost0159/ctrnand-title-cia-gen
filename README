ctrnand-title-cia-gen

This is intended to create "legit CIAs" from installed CTRNAND titles. It uses:
 - a dumped ticket.db (/dbs/ticket.db) for tickets,
 - title folder (/title) for contents.

"Legit CIAs" can only be made if the ticket, contents, and tmd are all properly
signed by Nintendo (i.e. modified contents still only work with sigpatches).

Encrypted titlekeys and tickets (which hold titlekeys) are taken from the
ticket.db and put in encTitleKeys.bin and a tickets folder respectively,
decrypted on 3DS hardware using Decrypt9, then placed as decTitleKeys.bin.
Contents are encrypted using the decrypted titlekeys to match the tmd (if the
encrypted bit is set for the contents).

This might work with a decrypted title folder under "/Nintendo 3DS" if you force
the script to read all title IDs but this hasn't been tested. This might be
supported later. DLC wouldn't work for sure due to the different layout, and
that is not really worth figuring out.

Python 3 with PyCrypto (preferably PyCryptodome, which is actively maintained)
is required to use this.

Usage:
1. Dump ticket.db  and title folder from a CTRNAND image. How you do this is up
   to you (GodMode9, dumped CTRNAND, etc). Place them next to the other Python
   scripts.
2. Run dump_tickets.py on the ticket.db to dump tickets to a "tickets" folder,
   plus an encTitleKeys.bin file.
3. Decrypt the titlekeys using Decrypt9 on a 3DS with access to Decrypt9. This
   will create decTitleKeys.bin.

4. Place decTitleKeys.bin next to the other scripts.
5. Run gen_cia.py to generate CIAs in the "cia" folder.
